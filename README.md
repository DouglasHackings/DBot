# Additional Info
 
### Folder Structure:
 The main file that runs the bot, bot.js, can be located in the root folder.

 The commands that RBot uses can be located in /commands, and are organized into 4 groups:
 
 - /commands/admin: Basic moderator commands; purge, kick, ban, etc.
 
 - /commands/normal: Random fun commands anyone can use; avatar, say, gild, etc.
 
 - /commands/token: More advanced server settings stuff; modlog, command disabling, etc.
 
 - /commands/music: Music bot commands; play, loop, die, etc.
 
 - /commands/utils: Aren't actually commands, but instead helper functions other commands rely on.
 
 /tokens is the directory where RBot stores server preferences (in the form of json tokens) in.
 
### Running RBot on your machine:
 While most files RBot uses are committed directly to Github, there are 2 major things you need to do before being able to run RBot on your own.
 
 1. Install the node.js dependencies with `npm install`
 
 2. Create a file named "auth.js" (js because importing from json in Node 14 is weird) in the root folder that exports both your discord bot token ([obtained here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)) and Youtube API key ([follow instructions here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)). The resulting file should look something like this:
 ```js
 export const token = "discord_token";
 export const youtubeAPIKey = 'youtube_API_key';
 ```
After doing those two things, you should be able to `node bot.js` in the commandline and run the bot!
